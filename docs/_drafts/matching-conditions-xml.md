# Use record identification rules for customize record matching in Contact Center

A somewhat hidden feature in the Dynamics omnichannel is the record identification rule. Now I say hidden, but it is documented and used around the world so it's just hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for.
A record identification rule is simply a fetchXml specified in a dedicated column for the workstream record in Dataverse
